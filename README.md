# Ambatosirongorongo_mouse_lemurs
In this repository you can find the multi-fasta file and code to reproduce the phylogenetic tree in the manuscript: "New genetic evidence from the Ambatosirongorongo / Petriky complex in southeast Madagascar calls for an immediate re-evaluation of conservation strategies focusing on Microcebus manitatra"

We extracted the CYTB sequences used in Hotaling et. al 2016 and added 4 new individuals as described in the methods section of our manuscript. The multifasta file deposited here includes these new 4 individuals.
